# UX

## Strategy

The user stories were defined as follows:

- As a user unfamiliar with Rock, Paper, Scissors, Fire, Water, I would like to be able to read the rules on how to play the game within the site
- As a user I would like to be able to play the game against the computer

The acceptance criteria were outlined as below:

- The rules on how to play the game are easily accessible at any point
- Games are able to played against the computer

## Scope

The mvp for this iteration of the project is that games are able to be played against the computer.   

## Structure

The structure will be a simple one page site with a modal for the rules and the gameplay front and centre.

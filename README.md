# Rock Paper Scissors Fire Water

[View deployed site](https://krisjowen.github.io/rockpaperscissorsfirewater/)

Rock Paper Scissors Fire Water is an extension of the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game, introducting two new options in Fire and Water. There appear to be few options to play this online so there is a clear benefit to producint this version of the game.

# UX

## Strategy

The user stories were defined as follows:

- As a user unfamiliar with Rock, Paper, Scissors, Fire, Water, I would like to be able to read the rules on how to play the game within the site
- As a user I would like to be able to play the game against the computer

The acceptance criteria were outlined as below:

- The rules on how to play the game are easily accessible at any point
- Games are able to played against the computer

## Scope

The mvp for this iteration of the project is that games are able to be played against the computer and the rules to be accessible. The scope, therefore, should be simple at this point in that the site should not need any additional pages or functionality. It is foreseen that the game will be available on initial page load with the rules either readily avalable or only a click away.

## Structure

The structure will be a simple one page site with a modal for the rules and the gameplay front and centre.

## Skeleton

!!!! ADD WIREFRAME IMAGE !!!!

## Surface

A simple, clean design is all that is required here.

### Font

A playful font will be used to reflect the fact that it is a game being played. 

### Colours

The majority of the page will be a simple black and white layout. However, the icons used for gameplay can be given colour to highlight them.

### Gameplay Options

To provide further gameplay options it would be a nice addition to include 'best of' options, such as best of 3, 5, 7 and so on. Alternatively, this could be labelled as 'first to'. These options would add some purpose to the gameplay rather than an endless gameplay loop that is currently available.

### Limiting Colour Choices

The ability for the user to change the colours of the icons has been implemented. A potential downside to this is readability as some choices can make the icons hard to see or even invisible against the background colour. Giving preset colour options would get around this. A different solution could be to allow the user to also select a background or even text colour.

2. Choose 'Pages' from the menu on the left
3. Under Build and Deployment and then Branch, main and then root were selected and the options saved
4. Once created, from the main project page again there is a 'Deployments' option on the right hand menu. This shows the URL for the Github Page

## Cloning Project

Details of this can be found on Github's own [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

1. Within Github, navigate to the [main page](https://github.com/krisjowen/yubaba) of the repository
2. Above the list of files, click on the green 'Code' button
3. For HTTPS integrations, copy the web url given under the 'Local' tab
